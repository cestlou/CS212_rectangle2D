//Rectangle2D, page 452-3, #11.9 and #11.11
//
//Test program posted here:  Program2.cpp (capture of sample run below)
//
//    Submit only TWO files here: your implementation as Rectangle2D.cpp and
//    your header with just prototypes named Rectangle2D.h
//
//Follow the specification listed in text, which means your header file should have the following (and a lot more....):
//
//const int SIZE = 2;
//Rectangle2D getRectangle(const double[][SIZE], int);
//
//Limit #include to <iostream> and <cmath> for this project.
//
//ZIP your two files together, so Canvas cannot rename the files.  Only zip types allowed here,  I will use only your Rectangle2D.cpp and Redtangle2D.h files for testing with my Program2.cpp test code, so please don't alter my test code, nor expect me to use you whole solution folder.
//
//ALSO: Every file you submit to me MUST have your name, date, course information, as I will have many copies with the same file names.  (No name == No credit)
